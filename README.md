# CacheSim
Cache Simulator is a final project from my computer organization class (CSCE 312) I took at A&M. The program simulates cache memory in a CPU. It offers different cache read and write modes as well as a way to view the cache and RAM so that the user can see how the data moves around in a computer. Additionally, the simulated cache and RAM can be dumped to text files for later use. The development time was about 2 weeks and was coded in C++.
